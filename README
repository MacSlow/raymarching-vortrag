This is a temporary repo for preparing the talk about raymarching with C++ and
OpenGL.

Build-dependencies are modest:

	* clang++ 4.x or g++ 6.x
	* SDL 2.0.5
	* OpenGL 4.x

Currently Linux is really the only tested target-platform. macOS should work
too. Windows is still to be worked on. To build the binaries you do the usual...

	1> cd build
	1> cmake ..
	1> make -j4
	1> cd ..

The usage of raymarcher-gl looks like this:

	raymarcher-gl <shader-file> [<width> <height> <texture-file> <texture-file> <texture-file> <texture-file>]

Example use of the built executables:

	1> build/raymarcher-nongl
	1> build/raymarcher-gl basic-3d-raymarching.frag
	1> build/raymarcher-gl texture-terrain.frag 720 360 data/noise-256x256.png

Interaction - if available - allows some viewpoint or object/plane manipulation
with the mouse. The <SPACE>-key pauses the rendering-loop of a program and the
<ESC>-key quits a program.
